**Date**: December 2024  
**Purpose**: Comprehensive use case library for team review and selection  
**Goal**: Team will select 8 most important use cases from these 25 proposals

---

## Use Case 1: From Blindness to Prescriptive Action

**Status**: ✅ Core Use Case (Reference)

The ideal customer profile (ICP) for the initial MVP is a CMO of a mid-market DTC brand (e.g., Sarah, CMO of a $75M brand) who uses platforms like Shopify, Meta, Google, and TripleWhale.

**Persona**: Sarah, CMO, DTC Brand ($75M Revenue, $1.5M/mo Ad Spend).  
**Pain**: "Flying blind, wasting $200k+/month on the wrong channels" due to broken post-iOS14 attribution and conflicting metrics (TripleWhale shows last-click, HubSpot shows first-touch).  
**Goal**: Receive daily, actionable, cross-platform guidance to shift budget and maximize ROAS.

| Step | Module(s) Used | Action/Narrative Flow (CMO Perspective) | Evidence Alignment |
|------|----------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------|
| 1. Unify Data & See Truth | MEMORY (Attribution) | Sarah logs into the FACE dashboard (or the iframe embed within HubSpot/TripleWhale). She sees a single, unified view of performance, instantly clarifying that the Time-Decay Multi-Touch attribution shows Meta is 42% of revenue and Google is 31%. | Solves the Reporting & Analytics Limitations pain (17% average complaint rate) and the Cross-Platform Unified Reporting gap. |
| 2. Identify Risk & Prediction | ORACLE (Prediction) | The FACE dashboard shows a Predictive Alert Panel. ORACLE flags: "Meta ROAS dropped 12% week-over-week due to creative fatigue. Risk factors: High frequency and audience saturation". | ORACLE solves the Attribution Inaccuracies (Weighted Score 4.25) and provides the required 7-day fatigue prediction capability. |
| 3. Prescriptive Action | CURIOSITY (Recommendation) | Sarah reviews the top Insight Card: "Recommendation: Shift $50k from Meta prospecting to Google brand keywords" with an Expected Lift of $75k Revenue. The system provides a clear rationale ("Google Search is driving 3x more profit"). | Directly addresses the No Prescriptive AI/What to Do Next universal gap. The output must be clear (action, reason, expected impact). |
| 4. Execute & Impact | FACE (UI) + MEMORY (Logging) | Sarah clicks an "Apply Recommendation" button. The system logs the decision (in MEMORY) and executes the budget shift (in V1, this means drafting the move for human approval). | Omnify achieves the core value proposition: 18% reduction in wasted ad spend ($270k saved annually) at a price point ($799/mo) that is affordable compared to Northbeam ($2,500–3,500/mo). |

**Success Metric**: 18% reduction in wasted ad spend ($270k saved annually).

**Persona**: Marcus, Marketing Ops Manager, SaaS Company ($120M ARR, $2.5M/mo Ad Spend).  
**Pain**: "We're always reacting to problems after they happen. By the time we notice a campaign is underperforming, we've already wasted $50k. We need to catch issues before they impact revenue."  
**Goal**: Receive proactive alerts and automated recommendations to prevent budget waste before campaigns fail.

| Step | Module(s) Used | Action/Narrative Flow (Ops Manager Perspective) | Evidence Alignment |
|------|----------------|------------------------------------------------|-------------------|

ORACLE shows a "Pre-Fatigue Alert" for Campaign X: "Creative set 'Summer Sale' shows 15% engagement drop over 3 days. Predicted to hit fatigue threshold in 4 days. Current spend: $12k/day." | Addresses the need for proactive intelligence (vs. reactive reporting). Prevents waste before it happens. |
| 2. Root Cause Analysis | ORACLE (Risk Factors) + MEMORY (Attribution) | The system displays: "Root Cause: Audience overlap (78%) with Campaign Y. Frequency is 3.2x (optimal: 2.0x). Recommendation: Rotate creative or reduce frequency by 30%." | Solves the "Why is this happening?" question that current tools don't answer. |
| 3. Automated Prevention Plan | CURIOSITY (Recommendation) | CURIOSITY generates: "Action Plan: 1) Pause 'Summer Sale' creative set (saves $48k over 4 days). 2) Activate backup creative 'Summer Sale V2' (expected ROAS: 3.2x). 3) Reduce frequency cap to 2.0x. Expected outcome: Maintain revenue while reducing waste by $48k." | Provides not just "what to do" but a complete action plan with expected outcomes. |
| 4. One-Click Execution | FACE (UI) + MEMORY (Logging) | Marcus reviews the plan and clicks "Execute Prevention Plan". The system logs the action, pauses the fatigued creative, activates the backup, and adjusts frequency caps. Marcus receives a confirmation: "Prevention plan executed. Expected savings: $48k. Monitoring active." | Enables fast action without manual intervention across multiple platforms. |
